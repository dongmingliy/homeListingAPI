- Improve performance by adding proper indexing and make sure the search query is fast
- Paging on the server and UI
- More search fields like square footage and location(zip code,street name, neighbourhood name)
- Add/Edit/Delete homes from UI and API
- Add historical prices of the home and display a chart on the UI
